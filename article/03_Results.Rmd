## Timeseries {#time-series-results}

Figure \ref{development_burial_type} and \ref{development_burial_construction} show the region-wise time series of trait occurrence. If we ignore all other archaeological knowledge, we can construct the following narrative from them: \newline

In the course of the Bronze Age in Europe there was a trend away from body burial towards cremation. Around 2200calBC cremation burials were almost unknown in Poland, southern Germany, northeastern France and northern Germany. In the northwest, in Great Britain and the Benelux area, and in the southeast, in Austria and the Czech Republic, however, there were early cremation traditions. These contexts could be discussed as areas of origin of the later omnipresent phenomenon. While cremation burials lost importance in Austria and the Czech Republic as well as in the Benelux region during the Early Bronze Age and only regained their importance in the Middle Bronze Age, their share increased steadily in England. Inhumation and cremation were balanced here for a long time. The situation was similar in southern Scandinavia, where the proportion of cremation burials was much lower until the Late Bronze Age. In Poland and northern Germany, cremation became relatively suddenly and completely established with the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. In northeastern France and northern Germany this change took place already in the Middle Bronze Age. In both contexts, inhumation continued to play an important role.

With regard to the question of grave mound construction, the picture is considerably more heterogeneous. In Austria and the Czech Republic, flat graves were the dominant form of burial until the Late Bronze Age, but mounds became more relevant from the Middle Bronze Age onwards. In Poland, flat and hill graves remained in balance until the Middle Bronze Age, when flat graves prevailed. The amount of data from southern Germany and northeastern France is extraordinarily small: If one believes the sample, then a sudden, radical change from burial in flat graves to hill graves took place in southern Germany at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. In northeastern France there were no flat graves in the Bronze Age. Northern Germany underwent a development from the dominance of flat graves in the Early Bronze Age, a short phase of increasing mound construction in the Middle Bronze Age followed by renewed dominance of the flat grave custom in the Late Bronze Age. A similar development can be seen in southern Scandinavia: Flat graves clearly predominated, but were increasingly -- almost completely -- replaced by hills, until burial in flat graves became more frequent again at the end of the Bronze Age. Burial mounds were dominant throughout the Benelux region, but in the Early and Late Bronze Ages flat graves also occurred to a significant extent. In England, flat graves were a short phenomenon in the Early Bronze Age, which did not recur later. \newline

This narrative is wrong or inaccurate in some aspects. Please see the analysis in section \ref{time-series-discussion}.

## Cultural distance

Beyond the simple comparison of archaeological knowledge and information derived from Radon-B, Figure \ref{sed_region_matrix} shows the time series of squared euclidian distance for each region-region relationship. The majority of the curves in its top right half for *burial type* correspond to expectations: At the beginning of the Bronze Age, inhumation is widespread throughout the study area, so the Euclidean distance at 2200calBC is small in almost every region-region relationship. Only the Benelux region, where the share of cremation is already high in the Early Bronze Age, is excluded. From the Middle Bronze Age onwards, but especially at the transition to the Late Bronze Age, the transition to the dominance of cremation took place all over Europe. The SED values increase in this period and show clear peaks or several successive maxima. This rise is a consequence of the time lag in the transition processes as depicted in Radon-B: It is different in every region. At the end of the Late Bronze Age, the average SED is approaching zero again, as burial by cremation dominates in almost all of Europe. The early and complete adoption of the cremation rite in the Benelux area, as depicted in Radon-B, clearly sets it apart from the other regions. England, on the other hand, with its slow, gradual transition from inhumation to cremation, stands out due to its consistently moderate distances to all other regions. It remains without accentuated minima and maxima. The situation for *burial construction* is more complicated, as can be seen from the plots in the bottom right corner of Figure \ref{sed_region_matrix}. The distance does not seem to follow a general trend, but a multitude of local and temporally limited phenomena. This heterogeneity is of course also due to how correctly or incorrectly the proxy developed from Radon-B depicts developments in the real world. In the Middle Bronze Age, the Tumulus culture should bring about a fundamental reduction of the SED for almost all region-region relationships -- this effect is indeed weakly visible. 

Table \ref{tab:distanceandcorrelationtable*} shows that the distance networks of *burial type* and *burial construction* are not equivalent. There is also no significant negative correlation. The degree of agreement between two regions in the question of inhumation and cremation is therefore not suitable for predicting the similarity of developments in these regions concerning the dominance of flat or mound graves. Only for the time window at the transition to the Middle Bronze Age from 1800 to 1600calBC is the 5% significance level of the Mantle test almost undercut, thus suggesting a statistically significant relationship. 

For the relationship between the SED network based on *burial type* and the spatial distance several observations result from Table \ref{tab:distanceandcorrelationtable*}: Cultural distance calculated from these to variables does not seem to correlate with spatial distance. A significant correlation between the distance measures only reveals itself for the Early Bronze Age time slot 2000 to 1800calBC: Only in the Early Bronze Age, long before the universal switch to the Urnfield burial tradition, large regions directly adjacent to each other tend to undergo the same developments rather than the ones further away from each other. In the Middle Bronze Age the SED developments of the *burial type* variable undergo the peaks already observed in Figure \ref{sed_region_matrix}. The correlation between cultural and spatial distance over these peaks is low and even tilts between 1400 and 1200calBC, at the transition to the Late Bronze Age, into the negative -- although not significantly. The cultural distance between several geographically distant regions is then smaller than between several directly adjacent regions. Looking at the SED network of *burial construction* (Table \ref{tab:distanceandcorrelationtable*}), similar conclusions can be drawn as in the *burial type* context: The distance values here are larger overall, and the SED differences within the individual spatial distance classes are clearly more accentuated, but here, too, the early bronze age is by far the phase of the most substantial spatial correlation. It is only significant for the time slot between 1800 and 1400calBC. There is no time period with negative mean correlation for *burial construction* cultural distance and spatial distance, but also here the correlation coefficient approaches zero in the Late Bronze Age. 

The results of the simulation as presented in Figure \ref{simulation} confirm the expectation: In case of equal interaction intensity $I$ of separate populations, the correlation of cultural and spatial distance is weak (Figure \ref{simulation} A vs. C vs. E). It appears to be normally distributed around zero for many simulation runs, although individual runs can still yield remarkably high positive and negative correlation for certain time slots. The fluctuation of the correlation within one run can be strong and seems to increase for bigger values of $m_i$. If the interaction matrix $I$ is predefined to represent the spatial distance matrix (Figure \ref{simulation} BDF), then the mean correlation per time slot increases. The correlation increases as well with the degree of interaction $m_i$ (Figure \ref{simulation} D vs. F). Counterintuitively the fluctuation of the correlation is also here very high (Figure \ref{simulation} E vs. F). The correlation development observed for the variables *burial type* and *burial construction* fits to simulation runs in all presets, but becomes less likely if we assume $I$ to represent spatial distance and a high degree of interaction $m_i$ (Figure \ref{simulation} A vs. F). That's mostly because of the relatively strong negative correlation of cultural and spatial distance in the Middle and Late Bronze Age (1400 to 1000calBC).
