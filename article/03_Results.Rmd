## Time series {#time-series-results}

Figure \ref{development_burial_type} B and \ref{development_burial_construction} B show the region-wise time series of proportional trait prevalence. They are based on very (!) small sample quantities (Figure \ref{development_burial_type} A and \ref{development_burial_construction} A) and are therefore not statistically significant. Despite this obvious limitation it's possible to conduct a thought experiment and consider these results in isolation. A comparison with published archaeological observations based on literature study is provided in section \ref{discussion}. Carrying out this experiment yields the following narrative: \newline

*The overall picture is that during the Bronze Age in Europe there was a trend away from body burial towards cremation. Around 2200 calBC cremation burials were almost unknown in Poland, Southern Germany, Northeastern France and Northern Germany. In the Northwest, in Great Britain and the Benelux area, and in the Southeast, in Austria and the Czech Republic, however, there were early cremation traditions. These contexts could be discussed as areas of origin of the later omnipresent phenomenon. While cremation burials lost importance in Austria and the Czech Republic as well as in the Benelux region during the Early Bronze Age and only regained relevance there in the Middle Bronze Age, their share increased steadily in England. Inhumation and cremation were balanced here for a long time. The situation was similar in Southern Scandinavia, where the proportion of cremation burials was much lower until the Late Bronze Age. In Poland and Southern Germany, cremation became relatively suddenly and completely established with the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. In Northeastern France and Northern Germany this change took place already in the Middle Bronze Age. In both contexts inhumation continued to play an important role.*

*With regard to the question of grave mound construction the picture is considerably more heterogeneous. In Austria and the Czech Republic flat graves were the dominant form of burial until the Late Bronze Age, but mounds became more relevant from the Middle Bronze Age onwards. In Poland mounds and flat graves remained in balance until the Middle Bronze Age, when the latter finally prevailed. The amount of data from Southern Germany and Northeastern France is extraordinarily small: If one believes the sample, then a sudden, radical change from burial in flat graves to hill graves took place in Southern Germany at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. In Northeastern France there were no flat graves in the Bronze Age. Northern Germany underwent a development from the dominance of flat graves in the Early Bronze Age, a short phase of increasing mound construction in the Middle Bronze Age followed by renewed dominance of the flat grave custom in the Late Bronze Age. A similar development can be observed in Southern Scandinavia: Flat graves clearly predominated, but were increasingly -- almost completely -- replaced by mounds, until burial in flat graves became more frequent again at the end of the Bronze Age. Burial mounds were dominant throughout the Benelux region, but in the Early and Late Bronze Ages flat graves also occurred to a significant extent. In England flat graves were a short phenomenon in the Early Bronze Age, which did not recur later.* \newline

## Cultural distance

Beyond the simple comparison of archaeological knowledge and information derived from Radon-B, Figure \ref{sed_region_matrix} shows the time series of squared Euclidean distance for each region-region relationship. The majority of the curves in its top right half for *burial type* correspond to expectations: At the beginning of the Bronze Age, inhumation is widespread throughout the study area, so the Euclidean distance at 2200 calBC is small in almost every region-region relationship. Only the Benelux countries, where the share of cremation is already high in the Early Bronze Age, are excluded. From the Middle Bronze Age onwards, but especially at the transition to the Late Bronze Age, the transition to the dominance of cremation took place all over Europe. The SED values increase in this period and show clear peaks or several successive maxima. This rise is a consequence of the time lag in the transition processes as depicted in Radon-B: It is different in every region. At the end of the Late Bronze Age, the average SED is approaching zero again, as burial by cremation dominates in almost all of Europe. The early and complete adoption of the cremation rite in the Benelux area, as depicted in Radon-B, clearly sets it apart from the other regions. England, on the other hand, with its slow, gradual transition from inhumation to cremation, stands out due to its consistently moderate distances to all other regions. It remains without accentuated minima and maxima. The situation for *burial construction* is more complicated, as can be seen from the plots in the bottom right corner of Figure \ref{sed_region_matrix}. The distance does not seem to follow a general trend, but a multitude of local and temporally limited phenomena. This heterogeneity is of course also due to how correctly or incorrectly the proxy calculated from Radon-B depicts developments in the real world. In the Middle Bronze Age, the Tumulus culture should bring about a fundamental reduction of the SED for almost all region-region relationships -- this effect is indeed weakly visible. 

Table \ref{tab:dactb} and Figure \ref{correlationtimeseries} show that the distance networks of *burial type* and *burial construction* are not equivalent. There is also no significant negative correlation. The degree of agreement between two regions in the question of inhumation and cremation is therefore not suitable for predicting the similarity in the dominance of flat or mound graves. Only for the time slot at the transition to the Middle Bronze Age from 1800 to 1600 calBC the 5% significance level of the Mantel test is almost undercut, thus suggesting a statistically significant relationship. This moment of strong correlation is though not induced by similarity along the spatial dimension alone: The effect is still partially visible in the result of the Partial Mantel test, where the spatial distance is artificially counterbalanced.

For the relationship between the SED networks and the spatial distance network several observations result from Table \ref{tab:dacta} and Figure \ref{correlationtimeseries}: 

For the variable *burial type* an exception with significant correlation between the distance measures only reveals itself for the Early Bronze Age time slot 2000 to 1800 calBC. In the Early Bronze Age, long before the universal switch to the Urnfield burial tradition, large regions directly adjacent to each other tend to see the same developments. In the Middle Bronze Age the SED developments of the *burial type* variable undergo the peaks already observed. The correlation between cultural and spatial distance during these peaks is low and even tilts between 1600 and 1400 calBC into the negative -- but not significantly. The cultural distance between several geographically distant regions is then smaller than between several directly adjacent regions. 

Looking at the SED network of *burial construction*, a slightly different conclusions can be drawn: The distance values here are larger, and the SED differences within the individual spatial distance classes are clearly more accentuated. As well as in *burial type* the Early Bronze Age is by far the phase with the most substantial spatial correlation. But it is only significant for the time slot between 2000 and 1400 calBC. There is no time period with negative mean correlation for *burial construction* cultural distance and spatial distance, but also here the correlation coefficient approaches zero in the Late Bronze Age. These latter results in particular, however, are based on unsatisfactory few observations.

In general, cultural distance as defined here does not seem to correlate strongly with spatial distance, especially in the Middle and Late Bronze Age. However, this hypothesis is not conclusive at the moment as it is derived from a very small sample size.
