Figure \ref{development_burial_type} and \ref{development_burial_construction} show the region wise timeseries of trait occurrence. The relative proportion of each trait calculated based on ^14^C dates can be compared to the archaeological state of research:

- Cultural distance space

- Correlation of cultural distances and spatial distance

- Simulation: What is to be expected in case of influence of spatial distance?
