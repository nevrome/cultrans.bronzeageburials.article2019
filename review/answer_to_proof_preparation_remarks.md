# Your remarks

## 1 Please check whether the caption of Figure 4 is correct as set.

The caption is correct.

## 2 Please provide the significance of bold value in Table 3.

I do not understand what you mean by significance or what might be missing here. In Table 2 and Table 3 all p-Values < 0.1 are printed bold. They indicate observations that are significant to a certain degree. The bold value in Table 3 already is a p-Value.

## 3 Please check whether the caption of Table 3 is correct as set.

Yes, this is correct as set.

You'll find a picture attached to this email.
