# Final corrections

- The author affiliation in the bottom right corner of page 1 could be replaced. Instead of **Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Archäologie, Mainz, Germany** it could be **Institute of Archaeological Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland.**. Or is this covered with the Author’s Note at the end of the article on page 15? That's also fine.

- Page 13, Column 2, Paragraph 2, Line 1: **Cultural complexity** should be written in lower case: **cultural complexity**

- Caption of Figure 5: Superfluous space in **region -region**. Please change to **region-region**. 

- Page 15, Column 1, Paragraph 2, Line 10: Missing space in **Human14C**. Should be **Human 14C**.
